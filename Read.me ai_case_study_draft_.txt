# TITLE
Case Study: Apple Incorporated  Artificial Intelligence Into Useful Daily Life

## Overview and Origin
This case study focuses on Apple Inc. and it's artificial intelligence (AI) relationship with consumers. 

* Name of company
1. Apple Inc.  

* When was the company incorporated?
	1. Apple Inc. was incorporated in 1975  

* Who are the founders of the company?  
	1. The founders of the company were 26 year old Stephen G. Wozniak and his former high-school classmate Steve Jobs (then 21 years old).  (Britannica.com)

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
	1. With the invention of the first computer (the Altair 8800) by Ed Roberts, Stephen G. Wozniak aspired to build his own computer (Wikipedia. Altair 8800)  

	2. His dreams became a reality in 1975 when he decided to partner with his friend Steve Jobs. Working out of the Jobs family garage, the two decided to name their company Apple. (Britannica.com)

	3. They did not have a lot of funding, relying on Jobs selling his Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak selling his programmable calculator to fund their project. (Britannica.com)

	4.  A circuit board was the result of their efforts. However, "in 1977 Jobs insisted on the creation of a stand-alone machine in a custom-molded plastic case, 
	in contrast to the forbidding steel boxes of other early machines. (Britannica.com)

	5.  This apple II also offered a colour display and other features that made Wozniak's creation the first microcomputer that appealed to the average person. (Britannica.com)

	6. Commercial success was achieved through Jobs developing a professional management plan and by gaining substantial funding from investors.  (Britannica.com)

	7. Initial investors included the following: (1) Regis McKenna, a well-known  public relations specialist for semiconductor industry to represent the company; (2) Michael Markkula, 
	a wealthy veteran of the Intel Corporation who became Apple's largest shareholder and an influential member of Apple's board of directors. (Britannica.com)

	8. "Wozniak also contributed to the growth of the company by inventing a disk controller that allowed the addition of a low-cost floppy disk drive that made information storage
	 and retrieval fast and reliable with the ability to store and manipulate data - this was a game changer in the industry. " (Britannica.com)

	9. Between the two of them, Jobs and Wozniak successfully launched the company and the Apple II became the computer of choice for legions of amateur programmers. (Britannica.com)

 * How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 
	1. "Present day Apple has 6 investors,  with Berkshire Hathaway and Microsoft being the most recent investors.  (Crunchase. Apple.)

	2. "Apple has raised a total of $375M across 2 funds, with their latest fund being European tet fund." (Crunchase. Apple)

	3.  "Apple has 29 investments and also generates revenue through its services category, which includes advertising services on apple Platforms and third-party licensing deals,
	 as well as the Apple Care Brand." (Crunchase. Apple.)

## Business Activities
	1. Apple was the first company to launch an AI powered ,voice controlled, digital assistant  called Seri in 2011, which revolutionized the technological market. (Youtube. Apple
	 Adds to AI Arsenal with Purchase of Canadian Startup)

	2. More recently, Apple  purchase a Canadian startup, Darwin AI; however, this type of acquisition is not the first of it's kind to Apple. (Youtube. Apple Adds to AI Arsenal with Purchase of Canadian Startup)

	3. Acquisitions such as this have happened throughout the last decade  as Apple created an arsenal of high tec talent, highly advanced research, and those with AI PhDs and doctorial 
	(from other companies and competitors), which gave them a competitive edge. (Youtube. Apple Adds to AI Arsenal with Purchase of Canadian Startup)

	4. In the acquisition of Darwin, Apple has replicated this strategy by bringing in more machine learning PhDs, doctorial, and highly specialized AI experts and making them very
	 senior in Apple's organization. (Youtube. Apple Adds to AI Arsenal with Purchase of Canadian Startup)

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
	1. The Darwin acquisition brings talent with expertise in shrinking down neuro-networks into a smaller size so that it runs more efficiently on the iPhone, iPad verses the
	 cloud (so more privacy). (Youtube. Apple Adds to AI Arsenal with Purchase of Canadian Startup)

	2. Have the capability to shrink neuro-networks (using generative synthesis)  in this fashion will bring the AI technology to the Apple customer's fingertips. (Youtube.
	 Apple Adds to AI Arsenal with Purchase of Canadian)

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
	1. Apple's customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government markets. (US Securities And Exchange Commission . Apple Inc.)

	2. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers through its retail and online stores and its direct
	 sales force.(US Securities And Exchange Commission . Apple Inc.)

	3. Apple also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. (US Securities And Exchange Commission . Apple Inc.)

	4. During 2023, the Company’s net sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales. (US Securities And Exchange Commission. Apple Inc.)

	5.  No information about the market size of these set customers could not be found during the time allocated to this analysis. 

	6. Besides this primary classification, Apple also explicitly targets professionals working in specialized software like music, video, photography and all kinds of 
	design careers. (Simple Learn)
	
	7. These working professionals prefer Adobe’s Final Cut, Photoshop and related editing software which work well with Macbooks and IPads than other operating systems. (Simple Learn)
	
	8. Even better, business professionals prefer Apple products such as iPods and Macbooks for their day-to-day work. Products like iPads and Macbooks are lighter and portable,
	 so they are often selected by students (upper-class), educational institutions and teaching. (Simple Learn)

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
	1. Apple offers the following solutions to its customers: a better user experience, continuous innovation, hardware, software, and services integration, branding 
	excellence, ecosystem lock-in, effective supply chain management, strategic partnerships, and long-term vision." (Apple Inc.: Sustaining a Competitive Advantage)

	2. Some of the unfair advantages that Apple utilizes are the following: 

	3. "Apple wage war on hardware and chip design. They don't manufacture 100% of their component, and some mission-critical ones are usually subcontracted 
	to Samsung or Sony (screens, displays, cameras), but still, they master their hardware architecture from top to bottom. And they have years (decades by Intel standards now)
	 of advance in chip design with their "M" and now "R" series." (Apple's Unfair Advantages)

	4. "Unique OS capabilities honed on many different form factors. From the watch to the traditional computer, the TV box, the car, or the tablet, Apple 
	has unique skills in creating the core software layer for an incredible number of form factors, usages, and hardware. And it isn't easy to come up with many companies
	 that could beat them at offering a more robust developer platform to produce software and content. This is a very short list of two names. Microsoft and Google.
	 Both of them without the same chip design integration as Apple, for now." (Apple's Unfair Advantages)

	5. "A robust network effect with their large community of developers. Another older key advantage Apple has invested tons of time and money into is certainly its developers'
	 community." (Apple's Unfair Advantages)

	6. "The timing might be rather smart. Given all of the above, Apple might be earlier than usual to the market, but not too early. If only because they have at least 
	six months before shipping anything, and they probably secured many major content producers a year ago or so (we only know about Disney for now). In any case, the message 
	has been vastly broadcasted. This is a first iteration for early adopters, a launching pad that should (will?) open the door to more mass-consumer versions down the line."(Apple's Unfair Advantages)

	7. "With AR above VR, the positioning of the experience is aggressively smart. Not forcing everyone to adopt a central 'metaverse' as a hub to do anything with the device,
	 but a simple OS that can be shaped to multiple usages, many of them in AR and not forced VR, is interesting. Zuckerberg politely dumped the idea of people alone on their
	 couches after Apple's keynote, but forcing everyone into a dystopian and cartoonish virtual world seems way more difficult to swallow. And let's not forget that Apple keeps on
	 invalidating Meta's business model (high-level privacy, no activity tracking beyond what the OS requires to function, etc.)"(Apple's Unfair Advantages)

	8. "Worst case scenario, it's an affordable loss for Apple. Probably the smartest thing to consider is that if anything goes as Apple is currently planning, this device will only
	add 0.1% to its total turnover. Apple has less at stake here than Meta. The Vision Pro can just become a Mac Pro-category device that will give 100 or 300K units to the creative
	industry every year, and nothing bad will happen for the trillion-dollar market cap company. Cook's ego will be bruised for sure, but he doesn't seem to be the type that would
	 care much." (Apple's Unfair Advantages)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering 
blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
	1. Apple currently uses 44  technology products and services including HTML5, jQuery,  Google Analytics (according to G2Stack, BuiltWith, which include Viewport Meta,
	 Iphone/Mobile Compatible, and domain Not Resolving.  (Apple's Current Technologies.) 

	2. Apple is actively using 86 technologies for its website, according to Apple's upcoming releases include the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, Apple GPT AI model,
	 Apple Watch Series 10 with MicroLED display and blood pressure monitoring, new iPads with M3 chip, and the AirPods 4 with ANC feature. (Apple's Current Technologies.) 

## Landscape
* What field is the company in?
	1. Apple is in the field of consumer electronics software services, computer software, and online services.  (Wikipedia. Apple Inc)   

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
	1. Major trends and innovation of this field over the last 5 - 10 years include the following: smartphones and the 5G revolution, electric vehicles and self-driving
	 cars, wearable technology, AI, augmented reality (AR), voice recognition technology, The Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing technology. (Ignitec)

	2. Apple specific trends and innovation of this field over the last 5 - 10 years include:  Apple's iconic iPhone is an innovation that became an integral part of 
	many people's lives because of how it replaced most devices users use every day. The iPhone introduced not only the idea of a pocketable, wireless phone for communication
	but also acted as a replacement for other things. (Ignitec)

	3. Apple entered several new categories over the past 10 years but none were more landscape-shaping as the iPad. An instant hit, the iPad took the 
	iPhone's 3.5-inch screen and super-sized it to 9.7 inches to make reading, watching movies, and surfing the web easier on the eyes.  (Ignitec)

	4. Additional Apple innovations recently include the following eight items unveiled in December of 2023: Apple Vision Pro mixed reality headset, 
	Apple 15-inch Macbook Air is now the thinnest laptop in the world, MacOS Sonoma, new privacy settings, updates to AirPods, big upgrade to Apple TV, Apple watch OS 10,
	 iOS 17 coming to iPhones and iPads. (Ignitec)

** What are the other major companies in this field?
	1. Other major companies in this field are IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Samsung. 

## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
	1. "Apple's $430 billion in contributions to the US economy include direct spend with American suppliers, data center investments, capital expenditures in the US,
	 and other domestic spend — including dozens of Apple TV+ productions across 20 states, creating thousands of jobs and supporting the creative industry.(The Impact Apple Inc Has on the Economy)

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
	1. "User retention is a critical indicator of whether your business is providing real value to your users. Analyzing which features are used the most, as well as how they’re used, and optimizing for that provides a competitive advantage. If your user retention is low, you can ask for feedback to help you create better product experiences." (Forbes)

	2. "Time to value is an essential metric for assessing tech project success and business impact. TTV gauges the time from a project’s start to when it starts to realize tangible benefits. Shorter TTV implies efficient execution, strategic alignment and rapid value generation, fostering competitive advantage. Monitoring TTV helps leaders optimize resource allocation, enhance performance and ensure projects stay aligned." (Forbes)
	
	3. "While ROI and budget adherence are critical, the satisfaction of the client (internal or external) is a key metric that should be measured when a project is delivered. The project needs to do what you set out to do according to the client, which includes staying on budget and achieving ROI. Client satisfaction should never be undervalued as a key metric for project delivery." (Forbes)
	
	4. "Our objective is to delight our customers by delivering exceptional value, service and usability through our products. To evaluate how well we generate customer value, we use product-market fit, which is a dynamic process that gauges value generated through factors including customer adoption, utilization metrics and Net Promoter Scores. High product-market fit creates deep and meaningful customer value."  (Forbes)
	
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

	1. Comparing the current results to its competitors, Apple Inc reported Revenue increase in the 4 quarter 2023 by 2.07 % year on year. The revenue growth was below Apple Inc 's competitors' average revenue growth of 8.58 %, achieved in the same quarter.  (CSI Market) 

	2. Valued at over $3 trillion, Apple is the largest company in the world by market capitalization as of December 2023. (Investopedia) 

	3. Samsung, with a market cap of over $374 billion, is another global powerhouse. The company makes up over a fifth of South Korea's GDP. (Investopedia) 

	4. The bulk of Apple's sales is from its iPhones. Though Samsung's smartphones account for the largest portion of its sales, the bulk of its operating profit comes from its semiconductor business.(Investopedia) 

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
	1. The ability to connect external devices to the IPads. 

	2. Create a stylus for the Iphone.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
	1. Offering the item listed above would improve the functionality of the Iphone and make it more compatible with other devices.  

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
	1. Adding a stylus would bring a tip like a pen and includes internal electronic components. Features include memory, electronic erasers, and pressure sensitivity
	 that allows lighter or heavier lines depending upon how much pressure you apply. (Wikipedia. S Pen) 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
	1. These are the technologies used by the Samsung stylus, which is very popular and in demand. Adding these technologies could bring additional 
	sales to Apple by converting traditional android users over to Apple.
